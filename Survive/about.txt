Survive was a school project between 3 members, made in Unity3d using unityscript (their version of javascript). It's a simple 2d shooter game with random map generation.
Enemies use A* pathfinding algorithm.

To try out the game simply extract the zip and run the exe.

Scripts folder contains all the source code programmed by our group.
