Survive was a school project between 3 members, made in Unity3d using unityscript (their version of javascript). It's a simple 2d shooter game with random map generation using perlin noise.
Enemies use A* pathfinding algorithm in a tile based map (Internally the game uses a tile based map for calculations and object storage, but for collisions, unity's 2D colliders are used).

To try out the game simply extract the zip and run the exe.

Scripts folder contains all the source code programmed by our group.
